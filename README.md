# Ballot

Ballot enables communities to organize elections.

Built using the Frappe Framework for the FOSS United Platform, Ballot enables
communities to seek candidatures from interested members of the community via
customizable forms. Ballot also enables members of the community to endorse
submissions. In the future, Ballot will also be integrated with a voting
platform where the community can cast votes.
